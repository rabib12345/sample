           <h2>Our team works together with the Client and upon completion of the design, they form several documents, each of which describes a specific aspect of the project.</h2>



<div>1. Analysis of competitors' products</div>

We study technical solutions of the main competitors, read comments and reviews. As a result, we understand their main disadvantages and advantages, on the basis of which we give recommendations to the client on the UI and functionality.

<div>3. Story Mapping</div>

<P>It is imperative to understand user scenarios, roles, and their interactions. In our experience, a convenient tool for this is the construction of Story Mapping, in which it is convenient to display both the description of scenarios and to prioritize them.
     Also, thanks to such a decomposition, our team and the client come to the same understanding of the product - <div>this allows us to avoid a significant revision of the functionality of the product after the start of development, which is always a waste of both time and money for the client.</div>

<P>4. Interactive prototype</p>
    

We design wireframes for the main product screens and then combine them into an interactive clickable prototype. The complexity of the prototype can vary depending on the project - it can contain a different number of screens, have more or less elaborate animations and visual design. 
The main goal of the prototype is to visualize user scenarios and understand the scope of work on the visual part of the product.
<P>5. Terms of reference for development</P>
<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="soft.jpg"height="400"width="600">
</div>

As a rule, this is a rather lengthy document that aggregates both functional and non-functional requirements for a product.<div> The description of tasks in the terms of reference already includes a description of the solution architecture, integrations with external systems (for example, payment systems, map services, etc.), requirements for the technologies used, protocols for the interaction of various parts of the product, and so on.
